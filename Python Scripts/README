These two scripts are what are needed to receive the data and get it into munin


android_:
android_ is the munin plugin. It is a wildcard plugin, and should be symlinked in the munin directory with the device you want to monitor's unique id at the end.
It should look something like android_bd52a2a1608bb3d3. You also need to the variabled gzipped in the script to point to were your data is stored.

handler.py:
handler.py is a python script that records the uploaded data into a file for the android_ munin plugin to read.
The storedir variable in it needs to be edited to point to where you want the data stored.
You also need to add directive to your apache configuration or .htaccess file for the script.
An example is as follows
<Directory "/path/to/where/the/script/resides">
                Options +ExecCGI
                AllowOverride all
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all
                SetHandler mod_python
                PythonHandler handler
</Directory>

The script needs its own directory to run in, in my configuration I use a directory on my munin apache vhost for it.
